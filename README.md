A social network named 'Zoocial' built on Native JS and DOM, using json-server as backend.
Currently working:

-  multiple user account creation and authorization
-  authorization is fake, meaning passwords are stored as plain text in JSON object
-  users can post, like and make comments

Planning to:

-  implement search and filtering
-  post retweet
-  trending section with most liked or retweeted posts

This project was created as a part of collaborative Hackathon
